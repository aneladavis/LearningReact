# LearningReact
Used a Youtube Tutorial to put together my first react app!!

Before running make sure that npm is up to date

in the terminal run: npm create vite@4.4.0
name the project whatever (I chose react-app following the tutorial)
chose react framework
and then select typescript

Open up vscode and go to the project directory

Open the terminal and run npm run dev
This should open a local host and provide the link

Download these files are replace the existing src file in the directory. 

Save and then you can see the changes
